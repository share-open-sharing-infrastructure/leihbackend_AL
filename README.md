# leihbackend

leih.lokal Karlsruhe management system. Succesor of [LeihLokalVerwaltung](https://github.com/leih-lokal/LeihLokalVerwaltung). Built with [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io) as a backend.

## Run
### Local
1. Download Pocketbase
```bash
wget https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/releases/download/v0.34.0/pocketbase_0.34.0_linux_amd64.zip
unzip pocketbase*
rm CHANGELOG* LICENSE* *.zip
```

2. Create schema / run migrations
```bash
./pocketbase migrate
```

3. Run Pocketbase
```bash
./pocketbase serve
```

4. Create admin account at http://localhost:8090/_/ (if none existing yet).

### Docker / Podman
```bash
# Option 1: pull official image
docker pull ghcr.io/leih-lokal/leihbackend:latest

# Option 2: Build own image
docker build -f Containerfile -t leihbackend:latest .

# Create persistent volume
docker volume create leihbackend_data

# Run the container
docker run -d \
    --name leihbackend \
    -p 8090:8090 \
    -v leihbackend_data:/pb/pb_data \
    -e DRY_MODE=false \
    leihbackend:latest
```

## Configuration
### Custom environment variables
* `DRY_MODE`: Run the app in dry mode, i.e. don't send any mail or delete anything. Default: `true`.
* `IMPORT_MODE`: Run the app in import mode, i.e. don't perform any sort of data validation or side effects when creating new records. Default: `false`.
* `LOG_LEVEL`: Log level to use for stdout (0 = `INFO`, 4 = `WARN`, 8 = `ERROR`). Default: `4`.
* `LL_INACTIVE_MONTHS`: Number of months after which a customer is considered inactive and schduled for deletion. Default: `24`.
* `LL_DELETION_GRACE_PERIOD_DAYS`: Number of days to wait until deletion customer after reminder mail was sent. Default: `7`.
* `LL_NO_WELCOME`: Do not send welcome e-mails upon new customer registration. Default: `false`.
* `LL_NO_DELETE_INACTIVE`: Do not delete inactive customers automatically. Default: `false`.

## API Endpoints
See [Web APIs reference](https://pocketbase.io/docs/api-records/) for documentation on what endpoints are available and how to use them (especially with regard to filtering, searching, etc.).

### Custom routes
* `GET` `/api/autocomplete/street` (public)
* `GET` `/api/reservation/cancel` (public)
* `GET` `/api/customer/csv` (superusers only)
* `GET` `/api/item/csv` (superusers only)
* `GET` `/api/rental/csv` (superusers only)
* `GET` `/api/reservation/csv` (superusers only)
* `POST` `/api/misc/emergency_closing` (superusers only)

## Authentication
For now, we'll only have _superusers_ (see [Authentication](https://pocketbase.io/docs/authentication/)) (as primarily other internal services are meant to consume the APIs) as well as a few _public_ endpoints (see below). In the future, we might actually want user accounts for our customers and thus define more elaborate [API rules and filters](https://pocketbase.io/docs/api-rules-and-filters/) then.

To call API endpoints (admin-only at the moment), an auth token needs to be passed, which can be created as shown in [`auth.http`](apidocs/auth.http).

## Authorization
### Requirements
By default, all operations are superuser-only, despite the following exceptions. 

#### Customers
No public access.

#### Items
* Public `list` and `view` access for items whose status is not `deleted`
* Field `internal_note` must be filtered

#### Rentals
No public access.

#### Reservations
* Public `create` access for new reservations
* Reservation cancellation endpoint `/reservation/cancel` is public (but requires the cancellation token, obviously)

## Tests
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Test cases are currently implemented in a way such that depend on one another. That is, if one test fails, subsequent tests are likely to fail as well due to inconsistent state, because tests currently are responsible for properly cleaning up their own data. 
> We should change tests to work **indepdendently**.

### Requirements
* NodeJS
* sqlite3

### Setup
```bash
cd tests && npm install --dev
```

### Run
```bash
cd tests && bash run_tests.sh
```

## Roadmap
For the long-term roadmap and future plans for out software setup, please refer to the [wiki](https://wiki.leihlokal-ka.de/software/roadmap).

## Developer Notes
### Deletion
* Deletions from customers cascade to all entities referencing customers using a foreign key, i.e. deleting a customer will also remove all their rental objects.
